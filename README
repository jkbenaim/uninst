NAME
       uninst - extract files from IRIX's inst packages

SYNOPSIS
       uninst [OPTION] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       uninst extracts files from an IRIX 'inst'-style package.

       file with no extension, the idb file with the .idb extension, and at
       least one image file with various extensions. Any of these may be
       given to uninst, as long as all of them are present and named
       correctly.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print a usage message on standard output and exit.

       -l     List files without extracting.

       -v     List files while extracting.

       -V     Print version information on standard output and exit
	      successfully.
